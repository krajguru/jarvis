IPA SERVER INSTALLATION

Below are the details of what the ipa-server-install.sh script does :
  i.   It will install IPA server on that node, with Kerberos REALM and LDAP domain as the domain name of the system. 
       For example : If your FQDN is node1.foo.com, it will setup IPA server with Kerberos realm FOO.COM and LDAP domain dc=foo.dc=com.
  ii.  The default password for "admin" user is "secret#1"
