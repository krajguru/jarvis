This script is designed to setup FreeIPA environment server/client [Tailored for squadron env, but can be made generic]

IPA SERVER INSTALLATION

1. Download all the files(except ipa-client-install.sh) in /tmp directory on the squadron node where you want to setup FreeIPA server.
NOTE: A node outside cluster environment.
2. Run the ipa-server-install.sh script as root user (Make sure ipa-client-install.sh and ipa-add-groups-members.sh have execute permissions)
---
# chmod 770 /tmp/ipa-client-install.sh
# chmod 770 /tmp/ipa-add-groups-members.sh
---

Below are the details of what the ipa-server-install.sh script does :
  i.   It will install IPA server on that node, with Kerberos REALM and LDAP domain as the domain name of the system. 
       For example : If your FQDN is node1.foo.com, it will setup IPA server with Kerberos realm FOO.COM and LDAP domain dc=foo.dc=com.
  ii.  The default password for "admin" user is "secret#1"
  iii. It adds ~100 users, 10 groups and each group has around 10 users. 
       Group names are in groups.txt file, to see group details use the below commands :
       ---
       # kinit admin
       # ipa group-show <group-name>
       ---
