This script is designed to setup FreeIPA environment server/client [Tailored for squadron env, but can be made generic]

IPA SERVER INSTALLATION
=======================

1. Download all the files in /tmp directory on the squadron node [node2].
NOTE: A node outside cluster environment would be ideal, but since we have resource limitiation we are installing IPA server on one of the cluster node[node2].
2. Run the ipa-server-install.sh script as root user (Make sure ipa-server-install.sh, ipa-client-install.sh and ipa-add-groups-members.sh have execute permissions)
---
# chmod 770 /tmp/ipa-server-install.sh
# chmod 770 /tmp/ipa-client-install.sh
# chmod 770 /tmp/ipa-add-groups-members.sh
---

Below are the details of what the ipa-server-install.sh script does :
  i.   It will install IPA server on that node, with Kerberos REALM and LDAP domain as the domain name of the system. 
       For example : If your FQDN is node1.foo.com, it will setup IPA server with Kerberos realm FOO.COM and LDAP domain dc=foo.dc=com.
  ii.  The default password for "admin" user and "hadoopadmin" user is "secret#1".
  iii. It creates a "hadoopadmin" user with "User Administrators" and "Service Administrators" privileges to manage hadoop clusters.
  iii. It adds 10 users, 5 groups and each group has 2 users. 
       Initial password for every user is "secret#1".
       User details are in file /tmp/users.out
       Group names are in groups.txt file, to see group details use the below commands :
       ---
       # kinit admin
       # ipa group-show <group-name>
       ---

IPA CLIENT INSTALLATION :

1. Download the ipa-client-install.sh on all the squadron nodes in the cluster except IPA Server node
2. Run the ipa-client-install.sh script
